I have already learnt Java and UnityScript (JavaScript syntax with Unity libraries), and intend to learn many more. Currently I'm learning C++, an Object Oriented Programming language with lots of freedom, no automatic GC, and general magic.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid foo(void);\r\n\r\nvoid foo() {\r\n  //2confusing5me\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### What on earth will I actually be coding?\r\nWell I'll be working on creating a simple game, perhaps Sudoku or Snake, maybe even recreate the arcade classic, Pong. Who knows? I'll be posting images of some of the cool things I've been doing, and will eventually release all the source code once I'm done with the unit at school.\r\n\r\n### Progress so far...\r\nAs of writing this, it's been a mere 4 days since starting C++. I've made a simple DOS game, utilising 2-dimensional arrays and a _game loop_, chaos ensues. The objective is to collect an artifact, and with each round, your previous avatar stays on the screen, making the game progressively more difficult. _Screenshots soon._\r\n\r\n## Stay tuned...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
